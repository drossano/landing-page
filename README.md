# landing-page
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to recreate a landing page using the html and css skills that I have learne up to this point.

I have previously completed the old HTML and CSS content that TOP offered and upon seeing that it has been updated I took it upon myself to re-do it. I'm glad that I did it, this content was much easier to follow than the previous Free Code Camp version. I felt much more prepared going into the Landing Page project than I did going into the Google homepage.
